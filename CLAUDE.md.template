## Spec Organization

Specs live in `docs/spec/`. They are split into **shared specs** (apply across features) and **feature specs** (specific to one feature). See `docs/spec-strategy.md` for the methodology.

```
docs/spec/
├── index.md          # Start here - overview and links to all specs
├── build-order.md    # Implementation order and dependencies
├── stack.md          # Tech stack, infrastructure, data flow
├── backend.md        # Shared backend: project structure, services, schema
├── ui.md             # Shared UI: layout, design system, components
└── [feature].md      # One file per major feature
```

**When working on a feature:**
1. Read the feature spec (e.g., `feature-name.md`)
2. Check the "Related Specs" table at the top - it points to shared specs with notes on what's relevant
3. Consult shared specs (`stack.md`, `backend.md`, `ui.md`) for infrastructure, patterns, and conventions

**Spec status:**
- ✅ Complete - Spec is written and approved
- 🔲 Pending - Placeholder with structure, needs content

## Key Documentation

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/spec/index.md` | Spec overview - start here for specs |
| `docs/spec/stack.md` | Complete tech stack reference |
| `docs/spec-strategy.md` | Reusable spec strategy (methodology reference) |

{{Add other key docs as they emerge - API references, data analysis, etc.}}

## Tech Stack Summary

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Backend | {{framework, ORM, database}} |
| Frontend | {{framework, styling, components}} |
| Infrastructure | {{deployment, networking}} |

See `docs/spec/stack.md` for full details.

## Working with This Project

**Default mode is discussion, not implementation.** Spec first, code second.

1. **Before coding:** Check spec status in `docs/spec/index.md`
2. **For stack decisions:** See `docs/spec/stack.md`
3. **For implementation order:** See `docs/spec/build-order.md`

### Before Suggesting Implementation

Don't suggest implementing a feature or section until:

1. **No unresolved TODOs** in that section
2. **No open questions** - they've been discussed and answered
3. **User has approved** - they've reviewed and agreed, not just you writing it
4. **Status is ✅ Complete** - explicitly marked, not 🔲 Pending
5. **Dependencies ready** - what this depends on is implemented or well enough defined to use
6. **UX/UI defined** (if user-facing) - flows, layouts, interactions, error states
7. **Big picture understood** - how it fits into the whole, no conflicts with other specs

### Dependency Awareness

Be mindful of build order. Before implementing X:
- Are its dependencies specced and ready?
- Are they implemented, or defined well enough to code against?
- Do you understand how X connects to other pieces?

"Well enough defined" = you know what it does, what goes in, what comes back. Enough to write code that uses it.

### Project Structure

Don't define folder structure or file organization too early. Structure is one of the **last things before implementation**.

Wait until:
- Big picture is clear
- Stack is decided
- Major features are identified
- You understand how the pieces relate

When you do define structure, keep layers separate:
- **Data/Models** - Schemas, types. Independent of how data is served or displayed.
- **Backend/API** - Business logic, endpoints. Knows about data, not UI.
- **UI/Frontend** - Presentation, interaction. Calls the API, doesn't contain business logic.

See "Project Structure" in `docs/spec-strategy.md` for full guidance.

## Keep Docs in Sync

**IMPORTANT:** Always update documentation as you work.

- When you implement something, update the relevant spec to reflect reality
- When you make architecture decisions, document them
- When you change something that affects other docs, update those too
- Mark spec sections as ✅ Complete when implemented and verified

The user may start new sessions and relies on docs being accurate. Stale docs cause confusion and wasted time.

## Spec Strategy Summary

This project follows the spec strategy in `docs/spec-strategy.md`. Key principles:

1. **Discuss before writing** - Specs emerge from conversation
2. **Living documents** - Update specs as you build
3. **Separate concerns** - Stack, backend, UI, features in separate docs
4. **Cross-reference** - Feature specs link to relevant shared specs
5. **Build order** - Know what to build first and why
